## Malloc tutorial

_TL:DR this will be a relatively short tutorial for implementing basic malloc,free,realloc function in C11 using mmap and best fit algorithm._

Let's start with a short introduction of malloc, as we all know malloc is used to allocate chunk of memory. It's signature is:
```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
```
- Allocates atleast 'size' bytes
- Returns pointer to the memory chunk or null if the space cannot be allocated
- Returned pointer is suitably aligned
- Malloc can't give that space to anyone else unless you free it

Okay most of that stuff is pretty much common sense, maybe except what is 'suitably aligned'. Well the alignment itself is necessary for 2 main reasons.
- Optimization (reading unaligned address requires multiple read instruction, aligned addresses require single read)
- Platform support (Unaligned access can trigger a processor exception and kill the program)

It's also undefined behaviour in C.

Let's start with very simple malloc implementation, we get the size user wants, call directly mmap with the size and return it, if mmap fails return NULL
```c
void *malloc(size_t size){
	void *ptr = mmap(0, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS , -1, 0);
	if(ptr == MAP_FAILED){
		return NULL;
	}
	return ptr;
}
```
But this one is very inefficient, we are calling mmap for every single allocation and we are also wasting huge amount of space. Mmap returns pointer aligned to a page size, so if we are gonna allocate 200 bytes we will have to allocate atleast 1 page, which could be 4KiB, so we would waste 3896 bytes
